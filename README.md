# FED1 Project Exam 1

Hi there! The creator of the Spice4life blog is me, Thu. My culinary adventure started a long time ago and has taken me to many kitchens and cuisines. I want to share my love of food, my best recipes, and the backstories that go into each dish on this blog. Food, in my opinion, has the ability to unite people and foster enduring memories.
